name: Publish Snapshot (Android)

# Workflow requirements:
#  
# This workflow relies on the following secrets:
# - GPG_SECRET_KEYS
# - GPG_OWNERTRUST
# - CENTRAL_SONATYPE_USERNAME
# - CENTRAL_SONATYPE_TOKEN
# These can be passed using the `secrets: inherit` option in the caller workflow file.
#
# The workflow also requires that the `ci-publish-staging` rule writes the following JReleaser
# environment variables to $GITHUB_ENV:
# - JRELEASER_PROJECT_VERSION: the version of the project
# - JRELEASER_PROJECT_JAVA_GROUP_ID: the group ID of the project
